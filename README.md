## Problem Statement

Mobile games often face challenges in retaining users, optimizing growth, and ensuring performance stability. This analysis aims to:

- Identify bottlenecks in the user funnel.
- Understand regional and iOS version-specific performance.
- Provide actionable recommendations for sustained growth and user retention.

---

## Business Impact

This project provides insights that can help:

- **Increase Revenue**: By improving funnel conversions and retention rates.
- **Optimize Marketing**: By identifying high-performing regions and user segments.
- **Enhance User Experience**: By addressing app crashes and improving engagement.

---

## Phases of the Project

### **Phase 1: Funnel Analysis**

**Goal**: Understand the conversion funnel from impressions to installations.

![Conversion Funnel](image/README/1733217207057.png)

- **98% Drop-off**: Most users drop off between impressions and installs.
- **Retention Strength**: High retention rates among users who install the app.

**Takeaway**:

- Simplify onboarding and improve app store visuals to reduce drop-offs.

---

### **Phase 2: Regional Performance**

**Goal**: Identify regional strengths and opportunities.

![Regional Performance](image/README/1733218095712.png)

- **Top Regions**: Asia Pacific and Europe dominate downloads.
- **Opportunities**: Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America need targeted campaigns.

**Takeaway**:

- Localize marketing efforts for underperforming regions.

---

### **Phase 3: Retention and Churn Analysis**

**Goal**: Analyze retention trends and identify churn factors.

![Retention Trends](image/README/1733217495281.png)

- **Retention Improvements**: Retention days increased from **30 in 2020** to **45 in 2023**.
- **Declining Churn**: Deletion rates dropped from **18% in 2020** to **10% in 2023**.

**Takeaway**:

- Introduce loyalty programs to retain users and reduce churn further.

---

### **Phase 4: iOS Version Performance**

**Goal**: Analyze downloads and crash rates by iOS version.

![iOS Version Performance](image/README/1733218049486.png)

- **Key Versions**: A few iOS versions dominate downloads, while others contribute minimally (<1%).
- **Crash Rate**: Low overall crash rate (~3.25%), but specific iOS versions need debugging.

**Takeaway**:

- Prioritize debugging for high-crash versions to improve user satisfaction.

---

### **Phase 5: Engagement Analysis**

**Goal**: Examine session patterns and active device trends.

![Engagement Analysis](image/README/1733219169568.png)

- **Engagement Peaks**: Align with updates or promotions.
- **Weekly Stability**: Weekly trends smooth out daily fluctuations.

**Takeaway**:

- Replicate strategies from high-engagement periods for sustained growth.

---

### **Phase 6: Crash and Deletion Trends**

**Goal**: Assess the relationship between crashes and deletions.

![Crash and Deletion Trends](image/README/1733219461352.png)

- **Moderate Correlation**: Crashes moderately influence deletions (~0.65 correlation).
- **Crash Rate Stability**: Crashes consistently account for ~3.25% of total events.

**Takeaway**:

- Focus on maintaining low crash rates to minimize deletions.

---

### **Phase 7: Forecasting Sessions and Impressions**

**Goal**: Predict future growth and plan resource allocation.
